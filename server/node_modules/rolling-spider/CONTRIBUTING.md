## Running the test suite

```js
$ git clone <git url>
$ cd <clone dir>
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

Funny story, as of right now we don't have many tests, they mainly live in the
`eg` directory for use with a real drone. Please, please, please if
you rock at test, help out!

### Fixing bugs

Bug fixes are always welcome. Please add a test!
